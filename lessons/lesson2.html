                <h2>The Human Factor in Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity within an organization. Even with the best security tools in place, human error can still lead to breaches.</p>
                
                <h2>Notable Cyber Attacks in the Philippines</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>PhilHealth Medusa Attack</li>
                <li>Identity Theft and Fraud</li>
                <li>Claim Issues</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Attackers Target You</h2>
                <p>Attackers are interested in you because you can provide access to company systems. Common risks include phishing attacks, weak passwords and credential reuse, as well as personal devices and shadow IT.</p>

                <h2>Why is Phishing Such a Big Deal?</h2>
                <p>Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous threats. It comes in many forms, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Email phishing</li>
                <li>SMS phishing (smishing)</li>
                <li>Phone call phishing (vishing)</li>
                <li>Fake websites</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Spot a Phishing Attack</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Unknown or suspicious sender</li>
                <li>Unrealistic promises</li>
                <li>Poor spelling and grammar</li>
                <li>Suspicious links</li>
                <li>Urgent or threatening language</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Avoid Phishing Attacks</h2>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Verify the sender:</strong> Always check email addresses and phone numbers carefully. Look out for small differences in spelling.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t click suspicious links:</strong> Hover over links to see the real destination and go directly to the official website instead.</li>
                <li><strong>Never share personal information:</strong> Legitimate companies will not ask for passwords, bank details, or one-time passcodes via email or text.</li>
                <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> This adds an extra layer of security even if your password is stolen.</li>
                <li><strong>Watch out for scare tactics:</strong> Messages that say “your account has been compromised” or “payment failed” are common tricks. Always pause and verify before acting.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t download unknown attachments:</strong> Malware is often hidden in files such as .exe, .zip, .pdf, or .docx. Only open attachments from trusted sources.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Malware</h2>
                <p>Malware is any software designed to harm or exploit a device or network. Common signs of malware include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Performance issues</li>
                <li>Suspicious pop-ups or ads</li>
                <li>Device overheating or loud fan noise</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Business Email Compromise</h2>
                <p>If you receive an unusual request through email, always verify it using another method of communication before taking action.</p>

                <h2>Insider Threats</h2>
                <p>Insider threats occur when employees misuse their access to harm the organization. Warning signs include copying information unrelated to their job, initiating unauthorized access, or creating unauthorized accounts.</p>

                <h2>General Tips for Staying Safe</h2>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Keep backups:</strong> Backups are the last line of defense if everything else fails.</li>
                <li><strong>Regularly update your systems:</strong> What was secure yesterday may not be secure today.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect your passwords:</strong> Store them safely, avoid writing them on sticky notes or in files like Word or Excel, and consider using a password manager. Use passphrases instead of short, weak passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Be careful with USB drives:</strong> Unknown devices may carry malware.</li>
                </ul>
